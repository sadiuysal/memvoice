## ‚ö° Performance Issue Summary
Brief description of the performance problem in MemVoice's voice processing or memory optimization.

## üìä Current Performance Metrics
**Voice Processing Pipeline**:
- End-to-end latency: [X.X seconds] (target: < 2.0s)
- STT (Whisper) time: [X.X seconds] (target: < 0.8s)
- Memory optimization time: [X.X seconds] (target: < 0.3s)
- LLM processing time: [X.X seconds] (target: < 0.6s)
- TTS (ElevenLabs) time: [X.X seconds] (target: < 0.4s)

**Memory Optimization**:
- Token reduction achieved: [X%] (target: > 70%)
- Memory retrieval time: [X.X seconds] (target: < 0.2s)
- Context quality: [subjective/objective measure]
- Cache hit rate: [X%] (target: > 60%)

## üéØ Performance Targets
What performance should be achieved?
- Specific latency targets
- Memory optimization goals
- Audio quality requirements
- Throughput expectations

## üîÑ Reproduction Steps
1. **Setup**: Describe the test environment
2. **Load**: Number of concurrent users/requests
3. **Input**: Type and size of audio/content
4. **Measurement**: How performance was measured
5. **Results**: Actual vs expected performance

**Test Environment**:
- Audio sample: [duration, format, quality]
- Content size: [if content processing involved]
- User session: [new/existing, memory state]
- Concurrent load: [number of users/requests]

## üìà Performance Analysis
**Bottleneck Analysis**:
- [ ] STT processing (Whisper API)
- [ ] Memory optimization (Zep retrieval/compression)
- [ ] Vector search (Pinecone queries)  
- [ ] LLM processing (OpenAI API)
- [ ] TTS generation (ElevenLabs API)
- [ ] Network latency (API calls)
- [ ] Database queries
- [ ] WebSocket handling

**Resource Usage**:
- CPU utilization: [%]
- Memory usage: [MB/GB]
- API rate limits hit: [yes/no]
- Database connections: [count]

## üõ†Ô∏è Potential Solutions
Ideas for performance improvements:
- [ ] Caching optimizations
- [ ] API call batching/parallelization
- [ ] Memory compression improvements
- [ ] Audio preprocessing optimization
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Infrastructure scaling

## üì± Environment Details
- **Deployment**: [local/staging/production]
- **Load**: [concurrent users/requests per second]
- **Hardware**: [server specs if relevant]
- **External APIs**: [response times from OpenAI, ElevenLabs, etc.]
- **Database**: [performance stats if applicable]

## üîç Monitoring Data
Attach relevant performance monitoring data:
- API response time graphs
- System resource usage charts
- Error rate metrics
- External API latency data

## üè∑Ô∏è Performance Category
- [ ] **Voice Processing Latency** - STT/TTS pipeline slow
- [ ] **Memory Optimization** - Token reduction inefficient
- [ ] **Content Processing** - Website scraping/vectorization slow
- [ ] **API Integration** - External service response times
- [ ] **Real-time Processing** - WebSocket/streaming issues
- [ ] **Database Performance** - Query optimization needed
- [ ] **Infrastructure** - Scaling or resource issues

## üî• Priority
- [ ] **Critical** - Severely impacts user experience (>5s latency)
- [ ] **High** - Noticeable performance degradation (2-5s latency)
- [ ] **Medium** - Performance below targets but usable
- [ ] **Low** - Minor optimization opportunity

## üîç Additional Context
Performance profiling data, user impact analysis, or related performance issues.
