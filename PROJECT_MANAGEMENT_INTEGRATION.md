## ðŸ“‹ Issue Management Strategy

### GitHub Issues Structure

#### Epic Issues (Major Features)
```markdown
Title: [EPIC] Phase X: Feature Name
Labels: type/epic, priority/critical, component/area
Epic Format:
- Overview and user stories
- Technical requirements 
- Success metrics
- Implementation phases
- Related issues list
- Timeline and milestones
```

#### Task Issues (Implementation Work)
```markdown

```

### Linear Issue Integration

#### Linear Issue Creation Workflow
1. **GitHub Issue Created** â†’ Manually create corresponding Linear issue
2. **Cross-reference** GitHub issue number in Linear description
3. **Status Sync** Linear status updates drive GitHub label updates
4. **Progress Tracking** Both tools track different aspects

#### Linear Issue Format
```markdown
# GitHub Issue Reference
**GitHub Issue**: [#X Issue Title](github-link)

# Implementation Details
- Detailed description from GitHub
- Technical specifications
- Acceptance criteria

# Progress Tracking
- [ ] Planning Complete
- [ ] Development Started
- [ ] Testing Complete
- [ ] Review Complete
- [ ] Deployed to Staging
- [ ] Production Ready
```

## ðŸ”„ Development Workflow

### 1. Epic Planning Phase
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Create Epic Issue] â†’ B[Break into Tasks]
    B â†’ C[Create Linear Project]
    C â†’ D[Link GitHub & Linear]
    D â†’ E[Set Milestones]
```

**Steps:**
1. Create Epic issue in GitHub with comprehensive scope
2. Break epic into individual task issues
3. Create corresponding Linear issues for project management
4. Link all issues with cross-references
5. Set milestones and deadlines in both tools

### 2. Task Implementation Phase
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Start Task] â†’ B[Create Branch]
    B â†’ C[Update Linear Status]
    C â†’ D[Implement & Test]
    D â†’ E[Create PR]
    E â†’ F[Code Review]
    F â†’ G[Merge & Deploy]
```

**Steps:**
1. **Task Start**: Update Linear issue to "In Progress"
2. **Branch Creation**: `feature/issue-number-brief-description`
3. **Development**: Regular commits with conventional commit messages
4. **Testing**: Ensure all acceptance criteria met
5. **PR Creation**: Comprehensive PR with issue links
6. **Review Process**: Self-review with checklist validation
7. **Merge & Deploy**: Automatic deployment to staging

### 3. Quality Assurance Phase
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[PR Created] â†’ B[Automated Tests]
    B â†’ C[Code Quality Checks]
    C â†’ D[Security Scan]
    D â†’ E[Manual Review]
    E â†’ F[Merge Approval]
```

**Automated Checks:**
- Unit test coverage >80%
- Integration tests passing
