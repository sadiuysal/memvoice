# MemVoice: Lean Business Plan

## Executive Summary

This lean business plan focuses on bootstrapping the service with minimal investment, rapid MVP development by a single developer using AI tools, and acquiring paying customers within 3-6 months.

By targeting specific niches with clear use cases and delivering immediate value, MemVoice can establish market presence and generate revenue while the product continues to evolve.
